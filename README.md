ïƒ°	By interacting with system-level DLLs using the ctypes library, Python is able to carry out tasks that are normally restricted by the Windows operating system. This is really dangerous, but it's also very strong.The Master Boot Record (MBR), registry keys, important system files, and privileges are all directly altered by the script. The machine could become totally useless as a result of each of these procedures.This script can cause permanent operating system harm if it is run without proper containment (e.g., executing it on a virtual machine with a snapshot) or without comprehending its impact.
